This project consists of coding a program that finds the lowest possible number of moves to
sort a random list of integers using 2 stacks and a limited set of operations  
For more detailed information, look at the subject of this project.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Requirements
The function is written in C language and thus needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

Instructions
1. Compiling the program

To compile, go to the program path and run:

$ make
2. Executing the program

To execute the program, run:

$ ./push_swap $ARG
where $ARG is a space separated list of integers, e.g. ARG="1 5 2 4 3"

Actions
PUSH

Take the first element at the top of one stack and put it at the top of the other; do nothing if the origin stack is empty.

pa - top element of stack b goes to top of stack a.
pb - top element of stack a goes to top of stack b.
SWAP

Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack; do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

sa - swap stack a.
sb - swap stack b.
ss - sa and sb at the same time.
ROTATE

Shift up all elements of the stack by one; the first element becomes the last.

ra - rotate stack a.
rb - rotate stack b.
rr - ra and rb at the same time.
REVERSE ROTATE

Shift down all elements of the stack by one; the last element becomes the first.

rra - reverse rotate stack a.
rrb - reverse rotate stack b.
rrr - rra and rrb at the same time.
USED ALGORITHM

I used a recursive quick-sort algorithm with the median as the pivot to make quick sort efficient. If the number of elements to be sorted is 3 or less, a different sorting function is used. There are two recusive functions to sort the stacks:

quick_sort_a, sorts the stack as follows :

Find the median of the len top numbers in Stack A (for the first iteration, len top numbers are the number of numbers in the list).
From now on, the median will be known as pivot.
From the len top numbers in the list, push those which are smaller than the pivot onto Stack B. 4.Use quick_sort_a on the len / 2 elements left in Stack A. Use quick_sort_b on the len / 2 elements pushed on Stack B.
quick_sort_b, works like this:

Find the median of the len top numbers in Stack B (for the first iteration, len top numbers are half the number of numbers in the list)
For the len top numbers of the stack, push those which are higher than the pivot onto Stack A.
Use quick_sort_a on the len / 2 elements which where pushed onto Stack A. Use quick_sort_b on the len / 2 elements left in Stack B.
